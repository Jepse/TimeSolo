# Time Solo 

**Time Solo** is a gamified productivity and personal development app that draws parallels between real life and MMORPG games, encouraging users to view personal growth as leveling up, achieving goals as completing quests, and building wealth and relationships as managing inventory and social panels. It makes personal development engaging by turning life's journey into a game experience, where every decision and achievement is a step towards leveling up...

## Concept Overview
- **Age = Levels**: Progress through life like gaining levels in an MMORPG.
- **Life Goals = Quests**: Set and achieve meaningful objectives as life quests.
- **Net Worth = Inventory**: Manage finances like an in-game inventory.
- **Relationships = Social Panel**: Maintain and improve relationships as part of the game.
- **Timeline**: An interactive timeline shows users their achievements, similar to a character's journey.

## Features
- **Gamified Life Management**: View your real-world growth through game-like mechanics.
- **Interactive Timeline**: Track your achievements and progress visually.
- **Data Security**: Full local data control, with no personal information shared online unless exported.
- **Cross-Platform Portability**: Planned import/export functionality to transition data between PC and future mobile versions.
