**Time Solo** is a mentorship app disguised as a gamified productivity and personal development app. It draws parallels between real life and MMORPG games, encouraging users to view personal growth as leveling up, achieving goals as completing quests, and building wealth and relationships as managing inventory and social panels. It makes personal development engaging by turning life's journey into a game experience, and turning yourself into the main character. Every decision and achievement is a step towards leveling up...

## Plans
- **Gamified Life Management**: View your growth through game-like mechanics.
- **Interactive Timeline**: Track your skill levels, achievements and quests progress in real time.
- **Data Security**: No personal information gathered or shared(serveless app) unless exported or shared by users.
- **Gamification Elements**: Attractive features for levels, quests, inventory, skills, etc.
- **Timeline Interface**: A interactive timeline that with a purpose.

### Idea ‚≠ê

Mentorship is lacking in modern society, i think LLMs trained and prompted to help the youth figure out how this world works is one of the best use cases. 


### Tech Stack & Drawboard

Pocketbase as a backend & DB, Vue frontend with ThreeJS(looking at Babylon for better WebGPU support), Readyplayerme web integration.
Here is a very crude and painted over lobby in it's humble beginning stage:
